        <p><strong>Robert Downey Jr</strong> is an American actor. His career has been characterized by critical and popular success in his youth, followed by substance abuse and legal troubles, before a resurgence of commercial success later in his career. In 2008, Downey was named by <em>Time</em> magazine among the 100 most influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by <em>Forbes</em> as Hollywood's highest-paid actor.</p><br>

        <p>As a child, Downey was <q>surrounded by drugs</q>. His father, a drug addict, allowed Downey to use <em>marijuana</em> at age six, an incident which his father later said he regretted. Downey later stated that drug use became an emotional bond between him and his father. <q>When my dad and I would do drug together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how</q>. </p><br>

        <p>Downey began building upon theater roles, including in the short-lived off-Broadway musical <em>American Passion</em> at the <strong>Joyce Theater</strong> in 1983, produced by <em>Norman Lear</em>. In 1985, he was part of the new, younger cast hired for <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, but following a year of poor ratings and criticism of the new cast's comedic talents, he and most of the new crew were dropped and replaced. <em>Rolling Stone</em> megazine named Downey the worst SNL cast member in its entire run, stating that the <q>Downey fails sum up everything that makes SNL great</q>. The same year, Downey had a dramatic acting breakthrough when he played James Spader's character's sidekick in <em>Tuff Turf</em> and then a bully in John Hughes's <em>Weird Science</em>. He considered for the role of Duckie in John Hughes's film <em>Pretty in Pink</em> (1986), but his first lead role was with Molly Ringwald in <em>Pick-up Artist</em> (1987). Because of these and other coming-of-age films Downey did during the 1980s, he is something named as a member of the <strong>Brat Pack</strong>.

        <p>From 1996 through 2001, Downey was arrested several times on charges related to drugs including cocaine, heroin and marijuana. He went through drug treatment programs, explaining in 1999 to a judge. <q>It's like I have a shotgun in my mouth, and I've got my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of gun metal</q>. He said he had been addicted to drugs since the age of eight, due to the fact that his father, also an addict, had been giving them to him.
        </p><br>

        <p>Despite all of the critical success Downey had experienced throughout his career, he had not appeared in a <q>blockbuster</q> film. That changed in 2008 when Downey starred in two critically and commercially successful films, <em>Iron Man</em> and <em>Tropic Thunder</em>. In the article <q>Ben Stiller</q> wrote for Downey's entry in the 2008 edition of <em>The Time 100</em>, he offered an abservation on Downey's commercially successful summer at the box office: </p>
